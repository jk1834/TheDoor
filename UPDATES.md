# Sprint 1

At the end of Sprint 1, we had the very basics of an idea of what we wanted to accomplish. We laid the groundwork for the Sprints to follow. We added a features tab in the README.md and updated the GitHub with User Stories and started working.


# Sprint 2

By Sprint 2, we had a fully functional website. The Create Account, Login, and Logout functionalities were all working as intended, and some CSS had been applied to make it look better. For Sprint 3, we hope to have the post feature completed.
Below is a small recording of where the project is at the end of Sprint 2.
